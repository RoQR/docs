## Register your account

To use RoQR, you first need to [register your account](https://roqr.app/users/sign_up). RoQR comes with a risk-free 30 day trial: no credit card required.

### Registering with email

To register using your email, fill out your full name and email in the registration form, and click the `Sign up` button.

After submitting the form, you will need to confirm your email before signing in. Look for an email with the subject `Confirm your RoQR email`.

To confirm your account, click the link within the email. After confirming, you will be redirected back to RoQR to set your password.

### Registering with Google or GitHub

You can also register through a third-part identity provider such as Google and GitHub. To register, click the button of the provider you want to use to confirm your identity. You will be redirected to the provider, where you will be asked to confirm that you want to allow RoQR to access your name and email for account purposes.

After you have confirmed the access, you will be redirected back to RoQR and be ready to use your account.

## Create your first link

After registering and confirming your account, you are ready to create your first link. On the main dashboard page, click the `New link` button.

On the next screen, you will be presented with a variety of options for what type of link you want to create. To read more about the various link types, read [the relevant section of the Link reference]('../reference/links').

Click the `URL link` option. On the next screen, you will be able to specify the settings for your URL link. Give your link a name, fill out the URL link target, and finally click `Save` to create your link.

*To ensure that you can view data and insights about the scans of your link, leave the Dynamic checkbox checked.*

Once you have saved your link, you will be redirected to a page showing you the QR code for the link, as well as some basic scan statistics. Scan the QR code using a phone or QR scanner, and refresh the page. You should see that the `Total Scans` statistic increased from 0 to 1.

Congratulations! You've now created your first dynamic link and begun collecting data.
